# Workflow Engine â€“ Infonetica Assignment

This is a minimal backend service that allows users to define workflows as state machines and create/transition workflow instances. Built using .NET 8 and ASP.NET Core with minimal APIs. The goal was to keep it simple, readable, and easy to extend later if needed.
